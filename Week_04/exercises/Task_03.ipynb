    "This Python code accomplishes the following tasks:\n",

    "Database Initialization: It creates a SQLite database named sample.db and establishes a connection to it.\n",

    "Table Creation: It creates two tables within the database:\n",

    "Authors: This table stores information about authors including their unique identifier (AuthorId), name (Name), and country (Country).\n",
    "Books: This table stores information about books including their unique identifier (BookId), title (Title), and the AuthorId as a foreign key referencing the Authors table.\n",
    "Data Generation and Insertion: It generates sample data using the faker library. For each author, it generates a random name and country, and for each author, it generates three random book titles. It then inserts this generated data into the respective tables, ensuring the foreign key constraints are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying the Database:\n",
    "\n",
    "It performs SQL queries to retrieve information from the database:\n",
    "It selects all authors and their books by performing an inner join between the Authors and Books tables based on the AuthorId.\n",
    "It selects books written by a specific author (here, assumed to be \"John Smith\") by specifying the author's name in the query and joining the Authors and Books tables based on the AuthorId.\n",
    "Printing Results: It prints the results of the queries to the console, displaying the authors and their books, as well as the books written by the specified author.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection Closure: Finally, it commits any changes made to the database and closes the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code generates sample data for authors and their books using the faker library, stores this data in a SQLite database, and demonstrates how to perform SQL queries to retrieve information from the database."
